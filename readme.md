# MonokaiJs's Neovim Config

Don't forget to install [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) before using this setup.

Clone this repository to this path `~/.config/nvim` as below:
```
git clone git@github.com:monokaijs/neovim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Open a new file with `nvim` and run `:PackerInstall`, then restart the `editor` to finish.

> Just put it here juse in-case anyone want this. Also GitHub is a good place to backup configurations.
